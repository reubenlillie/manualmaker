# ManualMaker

## Description

### _Make WordPress into your online manual_

ManualMaker was built for the [Church of the Nazarene][cotn-link], but it's not just for churches, and it's not just for manuals.

Whether you use ManualMaker to write a simple chapter book, a doctoral thesis, or to manage a complex reference document like the _Manual_ of the Church of the Nazarene—complete with section headings, numbered paragraphs and subparagraphs, indexes, or even more features—ManualMaker may be able to help make making it happen much . . . _much_ easier.

### _Make ManualMaker your own_

If ManualMaker can't make it happen out of the box, then _let's think outside it_. ManualMaker is made to be [extended][extend] so you can make sure that it can make whatever it is that you want to make with it.

## Installation

1. Upload ManualMaker's files to your `/wp-content/plugins/manualmaker/` directory.
2. Activate ManualMaker through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
